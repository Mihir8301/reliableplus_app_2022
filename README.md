The WHO has declared wearing face masks and avoiding physical contact as necessary biosafety measures in this Covid-19 outbreak. This project is created keeping all safety regulations in mind, and instead of a fingerprint scanner, it uses a facial recognition approach with mask detection, in which the face is identified rather than touch, minimizing the number of persons in contact.The technologies which are used for making this system are Image Processing, Internet of Things and Flutter.
